I have taught at Yoga on High since it's inception in 2000 and earned my certification from Yoga Alliance of ERYT 500 at Yoga on High. I love sharing this ancient practice with all kinds of people. I have seen it have profound effects on people's lives. It is an honor and a responsibility for which I am very grateful. 
 Eric and I have lived in this historic home for over 35 years, in what we consider the best neighborhood in the city, Olde Towne. We love sharing our home with friends and now airbnb guests. We enjoy walking in the woods, gardening, biking, kayaking, reading and, of course, practicing yoga. 
We also love to travel. We've been told we are easy guests. We like to take care of ourselves and not add unduly to our hosts workload. Car camping is a favorite vacation of ours.
 I'd say our airbnb hosting style is also casual: I try to think of anything a guest might need and supply it, so they can have a relaxed stay with us. We have maps of the neighborhood and menus for the local cafes and the bakery in a notebook in The Loft. We try to help out with rides when we can. We have a table in The Loft that is perfect for working or dining. A guest set up her sewing machine up there.

My wife, Julie, and I are now offering part of our overgrown Victorian house to Air BnB guests.  By day I am an attorney in general practice and landlord; Julie is a psychotherapist. By free time, we are musicians (mainly a cappella vocalists though with some harmonica, clarinet, a very little tuba and hand drums thrown in.  We  enjoy jamming and improvising with others). I am a motorcyclist and lover of small affordable British roadsters, a mechanical tinkerer. We  are rehabbers/restorers of old houses with avid interests in music of all kinds, art, books, film, food (the more local and authentic the better), all manner of whiskeys and especially conversation.  I am  French by birth, and still fluent. I would say we are  Midwestern/progressive  by long residence and disposition; usually gregarious, though sometimes quieter and observant. We like to travel fairly light, although we are probably  a little ""long in the tooth"" to be truly ""spartan.""  I suppose our  style of Air b&b hosting is to  provide a comfortable safe staging ground and general guidance from which guests can explore on their own.  Current life motto might be something like ""The best revenge is living engaged!""

my partner jeff & i are both currently grad students -- he studies the history of industrialization and labor in the u.s. south through a history of science & technology phd. program based in philly, and i'm a folklorist and oral historian who works on the history of sustainable agriculture, food & environmental justice, & everyday perceptions of environmental toxicity. that means i get to road-trip around this fine state alot, asking people questions about how they connect food and environment health, and how they've had their lives shaped  around those questions. 

as a folklorist and oral historian, i believe in the power of everyday people's embodied and lived knowledge and experience; and my work is in documenting, interpreting and helping to present these powerful perspectives to wider audiences, to create conversations for change. i try to bring these passions to everything in my life.

i'm interested in the ways people connect food, health and environmental concern; and movement histories and futures of activism around the stuff that makes us sick, and the stuff that makes us healthy. basically, if you wanna talk farm magazines from the 1950s or the poisons & boons of various audio recorders or just like food in general, i'm yr grrl! 

because of my own history of exposure and chemical sensitivity, we try to keep (as much as possible) a non-toxic home, free of meats, chemical cleaners, and scents. and, if you come in summer or fall, you're free to help harvest goodies from our bountiful yard garden! (the ""yarden."") it can get a bit weedy this time of year; but it's all chem-free and very well loved.

columbus, ohio is my hometown (and my favorite city on earth), and we're so blessed to get to do cultural work in and around the good and environmental systems in this lovely place. we absolutely love showing people this city -- from cultural tours to the best nature spots to restaurants (even pokmon)! 

our wonderful brilliant border collie isaly will be your prime host -- she loves our guests and will happily throw you some tricks (her newest one is ""step up and kisses"") and some cuddles. we also have a lovely matching kitty named nella.

Thanks for taking a moment to learn a little bit more about me. I'm a young professional who works in the Real Estate business - often times it consumes my days and nights; weekends too! However, I wouldn't have it any other way and I'm very passionate about what it do.

4. Laptop - Personally/Professionally 
5. Toothbrush/Toothpaste - clean and nice teeth are a priority to me.

However, it does not stop there; it's a two-way street I get to meet people from all over the world, with stories, culture, viewpoints that I have never been exposed to in my lifetime. It's fun!

Thanks for taking a moment to learn a little bit more about me. I'm a young professional who works in the Real Estate business - often times it consumes my days and nights; weekends too! However, I wouldn't have it any other way and I'm very passionate about what it do. 

Five things that I can't live without: 

1. My iphone! It's on your top 5 too! ;) 
2. My dog Tyson (Sheltie) - 5 years old & 18lbs 
3. Coffee - it's the first thing I do in the morning! 
4. Laptop - Personally/Professionally 
5. Toothbrush/Toothpaste - clean and nice teeth are a priority to me. 

I enjoy having Air BnB guest because Columbus is my roots and I get to share that with someone visiting. However, it does not stop there; it's a two-way street I get to meet people from all over the world, with stories, culture, viewpoints that I have never been exposed to in my lifetime. It's fun!

I'm Jake. I'm originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I'm a real estate investor and by night I'm a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I've been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love!

Born in Jamaica, grew up and attended high school in South Florida. Attended and graduated college with degree in Psychology and Business. Currently working in the Information Technology Field. I am very neat, clean and organized. Don't like drama and confrontation. Like the simple life.

I was fortunate to travel to more that 25 countries and numerous international cities. My favorite countries to visit were Singapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda, Dubai and Canes. Yes, there was the most scary countries I visited were Haifa Israel, Manama Bahrain, Alexandra Egypt and Kingston Jamaica. Most memorable country I lived in was Manama Bahrain. 

There are not many things I don't like with the exception of lizards. Most noted likes are electronic gadgets, riding motor cycles, watching track and field, playing soccer and various sports, cooking authentic Caribbean cuisines and learning about other cultures.

Let me see, 5 things I can't (well choose not to) live with out... Ummmm, 1. Amazon Alexa, yes she is like my living companion. 2. Electronic gadgets - have to have the man toys. 3. The internet - would be lost without being connected to the rest of the world. 4. Music and 5. Good food.

I love the quiet times to sit back and watch a tear jerker movie and at the same time can appreciate war, drama and military movies.

I am very open minded and love to welcome guest of all diversity. But if I had to chose the ideal guest, it would be... Someone honest, neat, clean, open minded about life, food, music of other cultures. Quiet but not shy to having intellectually stimulating conversations. Someone that can appreciate quiet times, wine, jazz and movies. I don't care too much for loud and rambunctious character.

As a small business owner myself, I am always eager to point guests in the direction of the best local establishments.

I'm Jake. I'm originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I'm a real estate investor and by night I'm a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I've been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother's advice, ""Jakey, live with NO REGRETS"" (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that? And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I've been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California and then Arizona where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I've been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California and then Arizona where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I've been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California and then Arizona where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.

People always ask if it's weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been ""not once!"" I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. So far I have welcomed people from 6 out of 7 continents coming from more than 40 different countries.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had broken plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. It's taken a lot of time and patience but a house that was forgotten and uninhabitable became a warm and charming place I like to call home. 

I'm proud of the work I've done to bring a historic building back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

I'm Jake. I'm originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I'm a real estate investor and by night I'm a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I've been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother's advice, ""Jakey, live with NO REGRETS"" (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that? And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Having stayed on friend's couches, in numerous hotel rooms, BNB's, and Airbnb the conversation has always centered on what would we do differently as a host.  From having a throw blanket for lounging on the couch, that certain kitchen tool, green space outside,  to having games available to play as a group or family.

Each of our animals has their own distinct personalities that make us smile and want to give them a hug.  This does not mean that everyone else does though. We each have several family members with pet allergies so we want there to be somewhere that is pet free, has items in it that have not been in contact with animals, like Wincott Place, to keep allergies at bay.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I've been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California and then Arizona where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.
